# Linear and Logistic Regression Model Design and Performance Analysis

This project aims to introduce the implementation of two common ML models, Linear Regression and Logistic Regression with Gradient Descent, on two distinct datasets: energy efficiency data and qualitative bankruptcy data. The task is to acquire, preprocess and analyze the data, implement the models, and perform several experiments to evaluate their performance. The experiments include reporting the performance of both models, analyzing the weights of each feature, observing the effect of training data size, comparing the convergence speed and final performance of different batch sizes and learning rates, and comparing the analytical linear regression solution with mini-batch stochastic gradient descent based linear regression solution.
